# From Teacher to Coordinator to Tech

I have always loved technology and after some years working in other roles I decided to invest in a Data Scientist carreer. I already know a lot about MS Excel, Power BI etc and have been learning SQL, Python, R and others for around 2 months. I have already developed some small projects for my current company (in which I don't work in tech) and I am being considered for a data analyst position in this company.

I have recently started the Sata Science (Powered by Ifood) Bootcamp at DIO. Below is a little of my progress until here as well as my LinkedIn account.

## Next Steps
I am really excited with this new journey and will be investing everything in pursuing this new path!
