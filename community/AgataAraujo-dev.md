# Hi there!

My name is Ágata and I am migrating from a Marketing career to Programming because I fell in love with the tools and endless possibilities for new achievements!
I am interested in becoming a Full Stack Developer, but I am starting with Front-End, following recommendations from professionals in the area close to me.


## Let's talk?

### Languages

This is my first Bootcamp, so I don't have much experience in any language! But I have a small project using HTML, CSS and Java to make a character selection page with animation for changes to the images, names and descriptions of each.
