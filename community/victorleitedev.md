# Victor Leite üìä
- As a brazilian Mechatronics technician and a Mechanical Engineer, I discovered my passion for programming in the college subjects and while learning Excel.
I started creating my own spreadhseets to organize my finances, and then smart systems to my family's company using Excel Functions, Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), MySQL and cloud platforms like Google Drive and Microsoft SharePoint. Later, I was able to use these skills to make a big project in my intership in the biggest Battery Factory of Latin America,  where I could digitize manufacturing process information, create smart Apps and spreadsheets to manage the data, and at the end generate usefull statistics and KPIs to the business. During this project I also learned about Microsoft PowerApps and PowerBI, and after finishing it I was finally sure about what I love to do.
- Now I'm studying about Web Applications creation using React.js and Django, and Data Science with Python and PowerBI, with the main focus on start creating very complete tools that will be adaptable to all the kinds of business imagined.
- It's just the beginning! üöÄ
